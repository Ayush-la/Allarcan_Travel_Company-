‚úàÔ∏èAllarcan Travels - Simple HTML Travel Website
Project Overview
This repository contains the solution for the "Design a Simple Travel Website using HTML" assignment. The objective was to create a single, static HTML page (Allarcan.html) that demonstrates proficiency in foundational HTML5 elements, structure, and formatting without relying on external CSS or JavaScript libraries.

Assignment Requirements Met
The allrcan file successfully addresses all components outlined in the assignment brief:

Structure: Valid HTML5 boilerplate, clear headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), and HTML comments before major sections.

Text Formatting: Correct use of bold (\*_), italic (_), uunderline/u (u), and sstrikethrough(s) in paragraphs.

Media: Two images (one destination, one activity) included using placeholder URLs.

Hyperlinks: Included an internal jump link, an external link (opens in a new tab), and a link to return to the homepage.

Lists: Implemented Ordered List (<ol>), Unordered List (<ul>), and Definition List (<dl>).

Table: A detailed table with four columns displaying destination, pricing (hotel/package), and an external link to the official tourism site.

Separation: Horizontal lines (hr) and line breaks (br) are used to organize content.
